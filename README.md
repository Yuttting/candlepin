# Candlepin Scorekeeper - Interview Exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The requirements and description for this exercise were added to the `docs` directory for convenience.

Overview:
- Update the LICENSE to either be open source OR to be copyrighted to you. This exercise is solely for us to review your code and skills.
- Create a new repo with this code as the base. There should be two branches: `main` and `devel`.
- Create a branch from `devel` and create the application there.
- Use the test data in `test-data` to test and develop.
- Once done, create a pull request, assign Joseph and Scott to it, and notify us of the code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Scoring
The assessment will be scored out of 100 points. Points are lost for the following reasons:

1. not following instructions
2. implemented features that do not work correctly (e.g. routing issues or unfinished buttons - UNLESS issues are called out either in e-mail, code comments, or the README)
3. code style: variable naming, usage of common programming patterns, unused variables, usage of classes and modules
4. complexity of code: is the logic easy to follow? any unused variables? does usage of OOP make the app easier to understand or more difficult?
5. broken or skipped unit tests - if any are written. Points are not lost if no tests are written, but bonus points are rewarded for working and useful tests
6. breaking React conventions without explanation in code comments, README, or other documentation
7. broken or not working backend / server code, if any is written. Points are not lost for not writing backend code, but bonus points are rewarded for working server or test server code
8. breaking normal CSS conventions
9. breaking normal JavaScript conventions
10. breaking normal HTML conventions
